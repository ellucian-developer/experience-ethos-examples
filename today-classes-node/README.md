  # Experience Ethos Example - Today's Classes Node

This example is part of a suite of examples that illustrate multiple methods to access institution data through Ethos from Experience cards and pages. This use case is a card that displays the student's classes that meet today. This example fetches the Ethos data through a Node microservice. The microservice accesses the data through Ethos EEDM (Ellucian Ethos Data Model) Resource.
