# Experience Ethos Example - Today's Classes GraphQL Proxy

This example is part of a suite of examples that illustrate multiple methods to access institution data through Ethos from Experience cards and pages. This use case is a card that displays the student's classes that meet today. This example fetches the Ethos data utilizing the Experience GraphQL proxy. Using Experience's GraphQL proxy avoids the need to deploy a microservice. The efficiency of GraphQL also reduces the round trips to Ethos by returning graphs of objects. There is some extra setup effort involved in loading the needed resources into Ellucian Data Access and authorizing the Ethos Application to use those resources.
