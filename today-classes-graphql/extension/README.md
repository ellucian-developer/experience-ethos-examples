# Today's Classes GraphQL Proxy Extension
This example extension includes a card that shows the student their classes that meet today. The data for the card is accessed through Ethos utilizing the Experience GraphQL proxy. Using Experience's GraphQL proxy avoids the need to deploy a microservice. The efficiency of GraphQL also reduces the round trips to Ethos by returning graphs of objects. There is some extra setup effort involved in loading the needed resources into Ellucian Data Access and authorizing the Ethos Application to use those resources.
