# Ethos Guide

This example uses Ethos Integration to retrieve ERP data.

## Ethos Integration Setup

This example needs an Ethos Integration Application's API Key to make the API calls to Ethos Integration. You can use the Integration Application used by Experience or create another one as needed. To create a new one, you can follow the steps as outlined in the Experience documentation [Create an application in Ethos Integration for Ellucian Experience](https://resources.elluciancloud.com/bundle/ellucian_experience_acn_configure/page/t_create_app_ethos_experience.html) for the purpose of these cards.

You will need to ensure the following resources are available on your underlying ERP APIs with the credentials used.

* student-grade-point-averages - Banner Ethos Data Model API or Collegue Ethos Data Model API
* term-enrollments - Banner ERP API
