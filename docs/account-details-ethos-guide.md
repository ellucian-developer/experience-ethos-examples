# Account Details Ethos Guide

The Account Details examples use Ethos Integration to retrieve ERP data from the BP API (Banner Business Process API).

## Ethos Integration BP API Setup

The account details examples need an Ethos Integration Application's API Key to make the API calls to Ethos Integration. You can use the same Ethos API Key that you used when configuring Experience's Integration Application or create another one as needed. To create a new one, you can follow the steps as outlined in the Experience documentation [Create an application in Ethos Integration for Ellucian Experience](https://resources.elluciancloud.com/bundle/ellucian_experience_acn_configure/page/t_create_app_ethos_experience.html) for the purpose of this card and page.

You will need to ensure the following resource is available on your underlying ERP APIs with the credentials used.
