# Today's Classes Ethos Guide

The Today's Classes examples use Ethos Integration to retrieve ERP data. Some of the examples make use of GraphQL and one of the examples use Ethos Integration EEDM resources to retrieve the needed data.

## Ethos Integration EEDM Setup

The Today's Classes examples need an Ethos Integration Application's API Key to make the API calls to Ethos Integration. You can use the Experience Integration Application (Using the GraphQL Proxy will use Experience's Application) or create another one as needed. To create a new one, you can follow the steps as outlined in the Experience documentation [Create an application in Ethos Integration for Ellucian Experience](https://resources.elluciancloud.com/bundle/ellucian_experience_acn_configure/page/t_create_app_ethos_experience.html) for the purpose of these cards.

You will need to ensure the following resources are available on your underlying ERP APIs with the credentials used.

For Colleague the following resources need to be owned by the Integration Application using the Colleague API

* buildings
* courses
* instructional-events
* persons
* rooms
* section-registrations
* sections
* subjects

## GraphQL Setup

The GraphQL examples need to have some additional setup. This includes loading the needed resources into Ellucian Data Access and granting permission to use the Integration GraphQL for these resources.

You can follow the Experience documentation [Set up GraphQL requests to Data Access](https://resources.elluciancloud.com/bundle/ellucian_experience_acn_configure/page/c_set_up_graphql.html).

The following resources will need to be loaded into Data Access and permission given to the Ethos Integration Application that you use for these examples:

* buildings
* courses
* instructional-events
* persons
* rooms
* section-registrations
* sections
* subjects
