# Today's Classes Lambda Ethos Guide

The Today's Classes example calls Ethos GraphQL from a Lambda Function to query for ERP data.

## Ethos GraphQL Setup
The Today's Classes example needs an Ethos Integration Application's API Key to make the API calls to Ethos Integration. You can use the Experience Integration Application or create another one as needed. To create a new one, you can follow the steps as outlined in the Experience documentation [Create an application in Ethos Integration for Ellucian Experience](https://resources.elluciancloud.com/bundle/ellucian_experience_acn_configure/page/t_create_app_ethos_experience.html).

Since this example uses GraphQL there are some additional steps to set up. This includes loading the needed resources into Ellucian Data Access and granting permission to use the Integration GraphQL for these resources.

You can follow the Experience documentation [Set up GraphQL requests to Data Access](https://resources.elluciancloud.com/bundle/ellucian_experience_acn_configure/page/c_set_up_graphql.html).

The following resources will need to be loaded into Data Access and permission given to the Ethos Integration Application that you use for this example:

* buildings
* courses
* instructional-events
* persons
* rooms
* section-registrations
* sections
* subjects
