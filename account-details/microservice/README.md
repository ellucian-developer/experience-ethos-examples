# Account Details - Lambda
This example utilizes serverless.com framework to define and deploy an AWS lambda function with AWS API Gateway as an API. The account-detail-reviews API returns the data from the Banner Business Process API endpoint account-detail-reviews.

The lambda account-detail-reviews endpoint does the following:
1. Allows CORS calls from Experience origins.
1. Verifies and decodes the Experience Extension JWT passed from the browser side extension.
1. Calls the card server configuration endpoint on Experience to retrieve the Ethos API Key.
1. Uses BP API to retrieve the current user's account details including their transactions and account balance.

Here is an interaction diagram.

# Setup

To deploy a lambda function and the associated resources using this Serverless.com project, you will need an AWS account, AWS credentials defined in your terminal of choice with sufficient permissions. A guide to AWS Credentials for Serverless can be found at https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/.

# Quick Start

To run the Lambda function locally in offline mode do the following

1. Open a terminal and cd to the account-details/microservice directory.
1. Execute `npm install` to install all the node modules needed.
1. Create .env. Copy the sample.env file to .env and add the JWT_SECRET and EXTENSION_API_TOKEN from Experience Setup Extension Management. Other .env vars are described below.
1. Execute `npm start` this will run the npm script 'npx serverless offline --stage dev'.

It will start an endpoint listening on port 3000. It will show you in a box with the GET URL. Copy this URL to use to configure the card excluding the endpoint. It will be http://localhost:3000/api

## JWT secret and extension API Token
You will need to create a JWT secret to share with the Extension Management and use in the .env file. This secret needs to be between 32 to 50 characters. Note if you can set the JWT secret in the .env file of the extension as EXPERIENCE_EXTENSION_SHARED_SECRET. Doing so will it will auto-generate an Extension API Token for the next step.

Once the extension is uploaded, an Extension API Token needs to be generated. Use Experience Setup Extension Management and edit the extension. Enter the JWT secret and then click on the "GENERATE API TOKEN" button. This will generate a Token that the server side can use to call back to Experience and get card configuration. Copy the generated token and add it to the .env file as the value for EXTENSION_API_TOKEN

## Other .env values for AWS Tags
The following vars are listed in sample.env can be used for tagging the AWS resources. See the serverless.yml blocks for tags. You can use or remove it as desired.

## Configure Card

Please follow the readme for the [extension](../extension/README.md)  to build and deploy the card and page.

Login to Experience as a user with permission to use Experience Configuration -> Card Management. Locate the Account Details card. This card has three items to configure.

1. Service URL - set this to the URL shown when starting the offline serverless, ending with /api (remove the /account-details-reviews). Likely this will be http://localhost:3000/api
1. The Pay Now URL is optional. This can be used to link to a payment provider to pay the amount due.
1. Ethos API Key - set this to an Ethos API key that has access to the resources as described in [Ethos Guide](../docs/ethos-guide.md).

## CORS and Serverless Offline

When running this the first time, serverless offline won't properly return CORS headers if you use the allowedOrigins block. The workaround is to set the httpApi.cors value in serverless.yml to 'true' initially or always when using serverless offline (running locally). When you deploy to AWS, it is recommended you use the commented-out cors block to be more restrictive of what websites can access your Lambda endpoints.
