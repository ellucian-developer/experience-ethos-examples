## Account Details Extension

This extension includes a card which displays the five most recent transactions on the current user's account. Clicking on the card will open a page which displays all their transactions in with more details.

For details regarding the extension see: [readme](extension/README.md)

## Account Details microservice

This microservice is implemented as a Serverless.com project which uses a JavaScript Lambda function in AWS. This extension makes CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) API calls to an AWS Gateway that triggers an AWS Lambda function. This Lambda function authorizes requests and calls BP API through Ethos Integration.
