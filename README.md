# Experience Ethos Examples

## Account Details Example
This example includes a card and page that show the current user their account details and balance. There are two npm projects in this example, an extension, and a microservice. The data for the card and page are acquired through the BP API (Banner Business Process API) through Ethos Integration. Additional data and behavior could include using a Pay Now feature that integrates with your payment provider.

These examples are detailed here: [account-details](account-details/README.md)

## Today's Classes Examples
This set of example projects is driven by the use case of having a card that displays the user's classes that meet today. This includes an Experience extension with three cards. Each card displays the same information using a different means of fetching the data through Ethos Integration. This example includes using Experience's GraphQL Proxy, a Lambda microservice using Ethos GraphQL, and a node microservice using Ethos EEDM (Ellucian Education Domain Model).
