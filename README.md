## Today's Classes Examples
This set of example projects is driven by the use case of having a card that displays the user's classes that meet today. This includes an Experience extension with three cards. Each card displays the same information using a different means of fetching the data through Ethos Integration. This example includes using Experience's GraphQL Proxy, a Lambda microservice using Ethos GraphQL, and a node microservice using Ethos EEDM (Ellucian Education Domain Model).
